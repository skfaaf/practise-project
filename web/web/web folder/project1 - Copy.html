    font-size: 28px;">One of the most common competency-based questions for any role requiring some project management
         experience is "Describe an important project you've worked on." There are a few reasons why
          interviewers ask this question. They want to see how well you can manage a project or a situation, 
          what your approach to dealing with challenges is, and how your skills would help you to successfully
           lead a project. They also want to know what your work ethic is like, and gain insight into how you 
           handle stress. So how are you going to answer this question?

        First, you need to prepare an answer in advance. It's very hard to give a well thought-out, five-star
         answer if you haven't done prep before your interview. To get started with prepping a response to
          this interview question, write out a list of all the important projects you've worked on in your
           career. Then, note what the goal was of each project, and what part you played in bringing each
            project across the finish line. Then, note the outcomes of all the projects.
