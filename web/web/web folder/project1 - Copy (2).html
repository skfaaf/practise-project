 Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized. 
 A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website.
Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality
might distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone of a web designer’s output is a site that wins and 
fosters the trust of the target audience, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible 
is a critical consideration.

Two of the most common methods for designing websites that work well both on desktop and mobile are
responsive and adaptive design. In responsive design, content moves dynamically depending on screen size; 
in adaptive design, the website content is fixed in layout sizes that match common screen sizes.
